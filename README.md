# UH_Sabine
R Scripts used to facilitate my work on Sabine Cluster, University of Houston.

This repository contains templates of R package "batchtools" which greatly helps researchers who need to work with schedulers (in this case "Slurm").

I first learn about batchtools from https://hpcc.ucr.edu/manuals_linux-cluster_parallelR.html

Original template script can be downloaded from https://github.com/mllg/batchtools/blob/master/inst/templates/slurm-simple.tmpl
